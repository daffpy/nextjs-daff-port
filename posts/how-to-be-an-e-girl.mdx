After few years living on a virtual world, i noticed how previleged girls are in an online community.
<br></br>
<br></br>

<br></br>
<br></br>
Simply being a girl or acting like one will give you an extra previlege that many men simply don't get on the internet.
Which is why some people then pretended to be a girl and catfished <i>simps</i> into being their own personal slave.
<br></br>
Though, myself won't fall into traps like that, since i am a true believer of <b><i>Rule 30 of the internet</i></b>.
<br></br>

<blockquote>Rule 30: There are no girls on the internet, unless proven otherwise.</blockquote>

<br></br>
But then again, you have to take every opportunity given to you, that is why i will be helping you boys and girls to
be the perfect e-girl on the internet!

<br></br>
Yes, the very first thing that catches any simp's eye. This is a very important component to master, since it defines who you are at the first glance.
<br></br>
These are the few things that you need to keep in mind when picking a profile picture:
1. For girls, use **YOUR OWN** photo instead of anime girls, _people w/ anime girls pfp is infamous for being a catfisher_
2. **DON'T USE SEXY PHOTO**, whether it is yours or someone elses <span className="italic whisper">(send it to my dms instead (¬¨‚Äø¬¨))</span>
3. **Don't use hot girls photo found on the internet**, There is only like 2% hot girls on the internet, touch some grass and you would probably find a lot of them.
4. If you are insecure about using your own photo, use aesthethic anime profile pic instead
5. If you are using anime profile pic, **dont use a close-up picture shot**, because **boys tends to use close-up shot** profile pic, and this is not about being an e-boys

This is another one that looks simple but instead very crucial to determine whether you're worthy or not to become an e-girl.
<br></br>
These are the few things that you need to do to make a perfect e-girl name:
1. Don't use **ALL CAPS**, show them that you are sweet and soft by using lowercase characters
2. Use **aesthethic symbols** in your name, to show the simps your "girly" side
    1. **Examples**: &lt;3 , üå∏ ,  ö…û, etc.
    2. Don't use **TOO MUCH** aesthethic symbols, literally noone cares if you have a lot of symbols
<br></br>
## <span className="font-bold segment"># How You Should Act</span>
<br></br>
Girls are usually more chill & shy than boys, so real girls usually dont talk too much in public space unless the girl know the person they're talking to. So, try to not be so chaotic and let other people start the conversation
<br></br>
Girls also love talking in caps, having typos and they are comfortable with it.
<br></br>
Also, try using a lot of cute and valley girl phrases, girls usually love using it and it will help you blend in with other people.
<br></br>
<br></br>
## <span className="font-bold segment"># The End</span>
<br></br>
In the end, all of this doesn't really matter, don't be insecure because you are not as wanted as the girls on the internet, because all of this also applies to all of the girls.
<br/>
Just be yourself and be confident with it. 
<br/>
Everyone is unique in their own way, don't let anyone including me to judge how you should act, how you should speak, and how you should f***ing crop your profile picture!
